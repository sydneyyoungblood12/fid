  <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>
  <p>This quick and flavorful spread is always a crowd-pleaser. My father has a great tip:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Make this the night before so the flavors can blend. Bring it to room temperature before serving. In winter, try it warm!”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (8 oz.) jar sundried tomatoes (preferably packed in oil, drained)</li>
    <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
    <li>⅔ cup kalamata olives, pitted</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon capers</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a food processor, combine the sundried tomatoes and garlic. Blend until as smooth as possible.</li>
    <li>Add the olives and capers. Pulse a few times—just enough to mix them in while keeping some texture.</li>
    <li>Serve on thin toast rounds. Optional: top with a dollop of goat cheese and a fresh basil leaf for garnish.</li>
  </ol>
